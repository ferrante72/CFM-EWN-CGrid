# CFM-EWN-CGrid
Elliptic Wall-Normal C-Grid Generator
## Description
The elliptic wall-normal C-grid generater solves the poisson equation to generate a C-grid over NACA 4-digit airfoils.
## Getting Started
### Dependencies
* Initial code compiled with gfortran
### Installing

* EWNCgrid code is available in the current file as EWN_Cgrid.f90.
* If user specified NACA airfoil profile is chosen, the files needs to be in the same folder.

### Executing program

* The EWN_Cgrid.f90 includes
* NACA airfoil profile generation
* Poisson solver
* Grid property and Fluent format file generation
